# Projects

*The project body contains the field life rule, field statistics, and the state of all field cells.*

[Snapshot](doc2_en.md) *data is stored separately and cleared when creating a new project.*

*In the application settings* <img src="qrc:/resources/img/setup.svg" height="24"/> 
*, you can choose whether to save project files in compressed, compact format (by default), or as plain text in* [json](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) *format.* 
*Keep in mind that the way the application tries to load the project file depends on which project saving mode is selected.*

*When creating a project, you can select a field rule and, if necessary, fill in the field with a choice of fill density.*

*In case of accidental filling of the cells of the field, cell can get only two states:* **ALIVE** *or* **DEAD**.
