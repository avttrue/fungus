*This application is designed to study the behavior of simple* [cellular automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton).

*A special case of such a automaton is the* [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

*The rules of this game are implemented by default in this application.*

*The only difference from the classic version is the field geometry. In this application, it closed, like a sphere.*

*The application architecture is designed to track the state of each field cell and collect statistics on field states.*
